# THAT'S LIFE
Third Term Project | Freshman Year | 

Co-authors: Yeohan Norona & Joaquin Escarraga 

A student-project imitating Marmalade Game Studio's 
"THE GAME OF LIFE" with some modifications.

This project is called "THAT'S LIFE". 

## Steps Before Running
In the assumption that you are running IntelliJ, do the following steps: 

  In File > Project Structure > SDKs > C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.2
  
  In Edit Configuration > VM options: --module-path "\path\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media

## Disclaimer
The project has not yet ultimately met all the specifications required.

There is an attached file "Specifications.pdf" 

## To Fix 

1. Some of the player stats are not working.
2. Player who has won the match still gets their turn after the move of the losing player.
3. Missing exit button.
4. Main Window does not become disabled after.
5. Missing pop-up windows for deciding paths / choosing houses / choosing careers / generally, choosing events.
   
   A. Replaced with Appearing/Disappearing Buttons on beside the paths of the game stage itself.
   
6. Match does not end right away.

## Author Note
Despite all these, most of the specifications were completed. 

The problem is the routing and connection of the GUI, with some simple fixes in the backend.


Amazingly, the major portion of the code was crammed for 4 days. 

Due to the time constraints, the debugging was left with no sufficient amount of time.

Feel free to modify the code. Cheers!
